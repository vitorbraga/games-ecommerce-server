# Games Ecommerce Server
This repository is part of a long-term project of mine, called *Games Ecommerce*.
Like the name says, it is an ecommerce focused on Games, to sell physical games and consoles.
All the products and transactions are fake, so in case of a user making order, this user won't be charged and also won't receive the product.

This repository is the backend for Games Ecommerce. It handles all the requests from the Store and the Admin Portal, and it manages the access to the database.

There are other two repositories that complement *games-ecommerce-server*:

- [games-ecommerce-app](https://github.com/vitorbraga/games-ecommerce-app): frontend Store, where users can see the products and make orders
- [games-ecommerce-admin](https://github.com/vitorbraga/games-ecommerce-admin): Admin Portal, so administrators can handle the management of products, orders and users.



## Current State

The project is in an MVP state. It has a basic e-commerce functionality. I still have a lot of features and improvements to make and I plan to implement them over time.
There are no tests implemented yet. I focused on features, like it is in a real-world company. Stakeholders want features, especially in the early stages when we are building a MVP. As this project is still a MVP, I decided to focus on fast delivering of the core features first.
Implementing tests is in my backlog, with a high priority.



## Live demo

You can find a live demo of this project hosted in Heroku:

https://games-ecommerce-app.herokuapp.com/

You can create an account and simulate orders. Feel free to explore it ðŸ˜‰

OBS: As this is hosted in a Free Plan in Heroku, the machine where this project is hosted can be idle. So, if you see to response, give it a couple of minutes and the machine will be active again.



## Stack

- **NodeJs**: Simple and fast to implement robust applications
- **Typescript**: I like it because it prevents lots of errors at compile time
- **Express**: Lightweight server, easy to use
- **TypeORM**: ORM in Typescript to simplify the access to the Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Database I chose for this project
- **AWS S3**: to store and retrieve product pictures
- **Multer**: to receive, validate and upload files to S3

This server contains a REST API which both the Store and the Admin Portal use.

***IMPORTANT***: to run the project correctly, you'll need to setup the proper environment variables for the desired environment. Please check the table below to know more about the necessary environment variables.



## Environment variables

This application is complex, then we have lots of configuration to do. As this configuration is either confidential data or is environment-based, we need to make environment variables out of them, so we are more protected and the application can run properly.

| Variable              | Expected values                                              |
